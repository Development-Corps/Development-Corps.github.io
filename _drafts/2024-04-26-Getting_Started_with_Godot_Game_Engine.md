Next, give your project a name and select a template to start from. Godot offers several templates, including 2D, 3D, and empty projects, depending on your preferences and project requirements.

## Adding Scenes and Nodes

In Godot, games are built using scenes, which are comprised of nodes representing various game elements such as characters, objects, and environments. To add a new scene, simply right-click in the Scene panel and select "New Scene." Then, add nodes to your scene by dragging and dropping them from the Node tab onto the Scene panel.

## Scripting with GDScript

GDScript is Godot's built-in scripting language, designed to be easy to learn and use while offering powerful functionality. With GDScript, you can add interactivity, logic, and behavior to your game elements. To create a new script, select a node in your scene, click the "Add Script" button in the Inspector panel, and choose GDScript as the script type.

## Building and Running Your Game

Once you've created your scenes, added nodes, and scripted your game logic, it's time to build and run your game! Godot provides built-in tools for exporting your game to various platforms, including desktop, mobile, and web. Simply select the desired platform from the export menu and follow the on-screen instructions to generate a playable build of your game.
